# Getting started

The content for all the pages is written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Content

Edit these files to add content to the site:

* [Home page](index.md)
* [About](about.md)
* [Mission](mission.md)
* [Schedule](schedule.md)
* [Contact](contact.md)
* [Fundraising](fundraising.md)
* [Zines](zines.md)
* [Resources](resources.md)
* [Merch](merch.md)

Look for the pencil in the upper right of the file to edit it.
Whenever you save a file the new content will be automatically published!

Don't change the stuff in between the `-----` ðŸ˜±

## Not seeing your updates?

If you make changes and they aren't showing up, [check out this page](https://github.com/imightbeamy/popgym/commits/master) and look for a red "x" or a green "âœ”" next to your change. If it's an "x" that means the build failed. Hover over the "x" and you should see "Failure: <error message>" telling you why. You can try to fix it or contact Amy and she'll take a look.

## Images

Then add `![this is a desciption of the image](assets/example.gif)` to one of the content files above.
