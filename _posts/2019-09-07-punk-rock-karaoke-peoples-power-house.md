About the Beneficiary: 

People’s Power House!
Why?
Cause the power of the people don’t stop!

Who We Are
PPH is a group of folks who wanna open up a space in north Brooklyn, focusing on self-defense and skill-share programming! We know a lot of folks who love martial arts, who love to learn it, who love to teach it. The problem is, a lot of these folks are either:
- Not participating in these spaces due to the overall all lack of care for anyone whose not a straight-gym bro
- Are participating in these spaces, but are fighting for a place for themselves (in addition to fighting in classes, tournaments, etc.)
- Are leading their own queer+, accessible classes, but are having a hard time finding cost-effective space to do the work

PPH hopes to try to address these issues by opening and maintaining a community space where folks feel comfortable learning the things they love, and that doesn’t require skill-share event organizers to break their budgets when finding a venue for their things!
 
Where Does the Money Go?
Financial transparency is super important for us, so that we remain accountable to the community we serve! We’re planning on a season long fundraiser filled with crowdsourcing and events, wit the hope that we can reach one of our financial goals in opening up a space (rent, insurance, maintenance, equipment, build up, and all that other fun stuff that goes into opening up a spot like this)

As we get all our social media and stuff together, please feel free to email us at pphnyc@protonmail.com for any questions, thought and/or feelings!
