SUBMISSION WRESTLING
It’s a full-body-entanglement sport where opponents lock up, grapple for control, and attempt to make each other surrender by using submission holds. It’s related to martial arts you might have heard of already, like Jujitsu, Judo, Sambo, or Trap Fighting.

Geared specifically toward absolute novices, this workshop will provide newcomers with a set of basic techniques that will allow them to hit the mats right away.

THE WORKSHOP WILL COVER
Safety concerns - how to play rough while minimizing risk
Objectives - closing the distance, taking the fight to the ground, finding a dominant position, and finishing a fight
Live training - attendees who choose to will get the chance to spar with one another or drill with a more experienced wrestler

QUEER COMMUNITY
The organizers and facilitators are committed to creating a safe and respectful space where queer people who are interested in martial arts can begin their training. No discrimination, no shaming, no harassment. Issues will be dealt with as quickly and tactfully as possible.

RECOMMENDED ATTIRE
