Hey all!
Definitely a first for us, but we're gonna have to cancel our events for the time being, due to health concerns surrounding Corvid-19. We super hate to do this because we LOVE doing our workshops, but the collective felt that it was best for us to conserve our energy during this time, and come on back when some of the health issues have gone down a bit. Until then, keep an eye on our social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) for updates, plus some health resources during this scary time. 

Thank you for understanding, and we can't wait to get back to it!
