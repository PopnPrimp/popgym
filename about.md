POP Gym is a new project, working towards opening a physical space in Brooklyn that offers free self-defense, fitness, and skill share classes 7 days a week. We believe that everyone should access to skills that are necessary for their survival. Our mission is to open up a space in which folks can attend classes on fitness, self-defense, and a variety of other skill sets. While that dream is a long-way away, we are actively taking steps to reach this goal!

As we continue planning, we invite you to come by any of our free self-defense workshops around NYC (and surrounding areas).! Our workshops have been described as, "fun", "holistic" and "empowering", and for any questions, comments, or inquiries for future workshops for you or your organizations, email us at [info@popgym.org](mailto:info@popgym.org). Check our schedule for a workshop near you, or email us to set one up for your group/organization.

## Mission

Pop Gym is an open gym where folks can come to jump, run, punch, roll, sweat, and dance together; a place where people can meet to learn from and build strong bonds with one another; a place where our neighbors can come and learn skills that we hope can help them to feel empowered and to navigate the world with confidence and security. We seek to add to and expand upon the rich tapestry of New York community spaces, through a rearticulation of the recreational facility; we wish to develop a communal skill space. 

Pop Gym has a variety of programming that acknowledges our always transforming bodies, meant to meet folks at their individual educational needs.  Education in our workshops is derived from the individual experiences and curiosities brought into the room. We have neither rankings, nor masters.

We strive to make Pop Gym a safe and secure environment, where we can work both from an understanding of the conditions that divide us and toward an intercommunal solidarity. We wish to engage in the process of community building while simultaneously understanding the need for practices that allow marginalized communities to discuss and develop in privacy. We try to meet people where they’re at.
