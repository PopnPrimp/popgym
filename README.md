# Getting started

The content for all the pages is written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Content

Edit these files to add content to the site:

* [Home page](index.md)
* [About](about.md)
* [Mission](mission.md)
* [Schedule](schedule.md)
* [Contact](contact.md)

Look for the pencil in the upper right of the file to edit it.
Whenever you save a file the new content will be automatically published!
