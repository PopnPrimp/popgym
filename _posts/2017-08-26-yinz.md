Palm Heels for the people! Don't get that joke? No worries! Come by this Pop Up workshop to learn some introductory skills that will keep you feeling safe. We'll be covering the basics: stretching, conditioning, technique, and theory, with the hope that participants will leave with some super useful foundations that will aid them in the day-to-day. Mix that in with some sweat and some movement, and you'll have an accessible and confidence-boosting good time for all. Whether you are a beginner, or someone with experience, come work it out with us!

Open to all ages! We'll be moving around, so participants should wear clothing in which they are comfortable stretching and sweating. As always, class is a suggested $5-15 donation but all are welcome, regardless of ability to donate. All proceeds benefit Planned Parenthood. Because we have a limited capacity for class, please register here: https://goo.gl/forms/llSLCtHomOtp0mRq2
