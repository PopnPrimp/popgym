**Hey all!**

Weird time ain't it (to say the least). We know everyone is going through it on their own way, so we wanted to offer this lil distraction! This is a scary time, and it is in these times that we believe in communities coming together, learning and growing, for the sake of their own health and survival. We have seen so many cool folks take the lead the past few weeks with some v cool projects, so we just wanted to be helpful in the way we know best: self-defense programming! We love offering self-defense workshop, and have been doing so excitedly for the last 3 years, and hope that our classes can bring some piece of mind to folks.

Please see below for some of our upcoming events:

 NOTE: This is an ONLINE workshop! Free to attend, but donations are welcome!
 
Palm Heels for the people! Don’t get that joke? No worries! Come by this FREE Pop Gym Pop Up workshop to learn some introductory skills that will keep you feeling safe. 

We’ll be covering the basics: stretching, conditioning, technique, and theory, with the hope that participants will leave with some super useful foundations that will aid them in the day-to-day. Mix that in with some sweat and some movement, and you’ll have an accessible and confidence-boosting good time for all. Whether you are a beginner, or someone with experience, come work it out with us!

Overview
* Intro (Overview and Rules of Workshop)
* Preamble (Group Discussion, Awareness, and Safety Zones
* Warm Up
* Techniques (Strikes, Defenses, and generating power)
* Closing (Discussion on COVID, and Final Thoughts)
* Bonus Section! (Self-Defense Against Grabs)

Find a space where you feel comfortable moving around in, ideally where you can stretch out your arms/legs without hitting anything!

Open to all ages! We’ll be moving around, so participants should wear clothing in which they are comfortable stretching and sweating.
POP Gym, providing free fitness and skill share classes all around NYC, will be facilitating a self-defense class every second Wednesday of the month at Brooklyn Community Pride Center.
