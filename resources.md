# Self-Defense Resources

### A list of some people and places we think are super great!

PLEASE READ: This list consists of programs, gyms, and resources that have been recommended by word-of-mouth and online reviews, or from list by groups whose work inspires our own (thanks to [Triangles Everywhere](https://airtable.com/applzTxanGiotFnB2/shrZHMpcWpMzJCBg5/tblmP9k1N1TWUhq7A){:target="_blank"}, [Southpaw](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkcF6z1JQ-0/){:target="_blank"} [Pod](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cu-9CHoLDME/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link){:target="_blank"}, [Angry Asian Womxn](https://linktr.ee/Angryasianwomxn){:target="_blank"}, and [QT Combat Arts](https://linktr.ee/queeringcombat){:target="_blank"} for their resource lists which helped populate ours. See their work linked below). We platform these groups due to their prioritization and centering of historically marginalized identities (i.e. Femme, LGBTQAI+, POC, Disabled etc.), their having members of those identities in positions of leadership (coaches, owners), and/or their having of a politic that inspires our work in creating space for those who have been traditionally pushed out of mainstream self-defense and martial arts spaces. 

Note: While we do our best to fully check out each resource we have listed here, situations may change without our knowing (i.e. problematic behavior might occur, a location might close, etc.). If you have any great resources to add (or any information on current resources we have listed), please feel free to email us at info@popgym.org, so that we work together to make a resource list that is beneficial to the community at large.
