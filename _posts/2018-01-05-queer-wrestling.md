Ever wanted to get into submission wrestling but we're sure where to start? Want to throw down with friends at a party, but aren't sure how to avoid potentially-injurious maneuvers? Need a few moves to muddle your way through as an absolute novice?

We've got a workshop that could help with that!


The Beginner's Tool Kit for Submission Wrestling

How to get started in the sport of Submission Wrestling, starting from the very top! Submission Wrestling is a full-body-entanglement sport where partners lock up, grapple for control, and attempt to make each other surrender by using "submission holds." 

Geared specifically toward absolute novices, this workshop will provide newcomers with a set of basic tactics and techniques that allows them to hit the mats right away.

- Safety concerns: How to play rough while minimizing risk
- Objectives of the game: Positions and Submissions
- ** How to start a match ** Ways to Engage while starting on the mats
- Basic attacks and defenses

Intended for: Beginners who will be wrestling fellow Beginners. Novices looking for a way to get started on the mats. Anyone who'd like to add elements of safety to their rough play. 

Low intensity and slow pace are strongly encouraged.
