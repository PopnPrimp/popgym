**Happy New Year!**

We're so excited to be announcing our online workshops for the coming year. Having done them for the first time in 2020, we are super pumped to be bringing them back on a monthly basis.

We're also looking forward to the warm times again! Stay tuned for more announcements for other events we'll have coming up once it's not so frigid outside.

Other than that, always feel free to reach out to us for private sessions, or general questions at info@popgym.org! Plus be syre to check out our [self-defense resource guide](https://popgym.org/resources/), our [free zines](https://popgym.org/zines/), and [our store (if you wanna snag yourself a snazzy pop t shirt and support our work!)](https://popgym-store.square.site/)

See y'all in 2021! Hiya!
