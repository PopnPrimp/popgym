We remember Heather Heyer!
NYC stands together against racism & fascism!

Please join us to break bread with anti-racist and anti-fascist neighbors, to mark the third anniversary of the far-right terror in Charlottesville, and to remember all those whose lives have been cut short by white supremacist violence. 

On August 12, 2017, far-right, white-supremacist fascists gathered in Charlottesville to try to build their power. We remember the brave anti-racist protesters who stood up to them, especially Heather Heyer, whose life was stolen by one of these violent fascists. We honor members of our own NYC community who were in Charlottesville that day as we gather to support their struggles and continue to build the kind of community we need to successfully push back against the far-right. 

There will be:
- a potluck picnic for all
- activities for kids and families
- time & space for collective mourning
- info on radical mental health services in NYC
- info on connecting with anti-racist and anti-fascist organizing taking place in the region
- a short self-defense overview by POP Gym
- and more!

This family-friendly event is open to all who affirm that bigots, fascists, and the far-right have no place in our communities, here in NYC or around the world. Bring your friends, kids, co-workers, partners, and neighbors: all are welcome!
