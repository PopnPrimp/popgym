THIS WEEK! Crown Heights Care Collective and Crown Heights Mutual Aid are teaming up for a day of fun, food, creativity, and community childcare at Historic First Church on Saturday, January 25th. From 12-5pm:

🧣 Pick up winter wardrobe essentials at the Free Store
🎨 Let your kids get creative with arts and crafts that invite them to build the village of their dreams
🍛 Join us for a hot meal provided by @crownheightsaid
🥊 Kick it with your kiddos at a self-defense lesson hosted by Pop Gym (1:30-2:30)



📖 Enjoy Story Hour with captivating children’s books and nursery rhymes

We will be accepting donations all day. Connect with other parents, educators, and caregivers to help build a strong childcare network in Crown Heights!

ACCESSIBILITY NEEDS
The building entrance is barrier free, but there are two sets of stairs to access the event. If you are unable to navigate stairs, the event greeters will find a “personal shopper” to help collect a meal and any clothing items they can locate that fit your needs (as long as they are available), while you stay warm in the building lobby.”
