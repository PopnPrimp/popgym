Pop Gym MMA coming back this Thursday at the Dreamhouse! Check the below for more of the #kickbutt details!

Pop Gym MMA! A weekly series for folks who want to learn a little bit more than basic self-defense, in a safe, holistic, and body-positive environment. 

Come by these free introductory workshops that combine elements of Boxing, Muay Thai, BJJ, and other fighting arts with a pad-smacking-fun workout and an all around good time!

*7:00-8:15: Women/Trans/GNC/NB Class

8:15-9:30 General Class

Wear clothing you don't mind sweating in. Recommended for folks to bring their own wraps (some wraps will be provided). If you got a favorite pair of gloves you like to wear, bring those too!

Thanks y'all!
