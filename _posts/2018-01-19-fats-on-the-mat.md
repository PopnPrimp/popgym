Fats on the Mats!

Have you ever wanted to try wrestling but weren’t totally comfortable going to a gym or studio? Come to the first ever “Fats on the Mats--wrestling for fat bodies” introductory workshop! Led by two hometown fatties you know and love (if you don’t yet, you will soon!).

Introductory workshop & practice tailored specifically for fat bodies for submission wrestling (aka submission grappling), open to all *fat identified* LGBTQ community and allies. Get started in grappling & meet new people on the mats in a safe and supportive atmosphere. We’ll be taking things slowly and gently and providing variations on movements for different ability levels.

Hosted by the people who brought you “The Spectrum Wrestling Nights.”

First-timers and returning people welcome alike! No experience necessary. Each workshop presents basic introductory moves that can stand alone or be linked with moves from previous workshops.

**Accessibility info: Wrestling space is located down half a flight of stairs. Unfortunately, there is no ramp or elevator. Please comment or direct message with questions or concerns.

***Buzzer 6 for entry*****

This workshop is for fat-identified people. Open to all levels, all genders. Oriented toward beginners.

The objective in Submission Wrestling is to wrestle your opponent into a controlling position from which you can apply a "submission hold" (strangle or joint lock) to make the opponent give up, "tap out."

The workshop will feature:
- An activity-specific warm-up
- Footwork practice
- Demonstrations of techniques to get you started
- Time for repetition and technical practice
- Live sparring practice, for those who'd like to try.

Emphasis will be on ground techniques.

All skill levels welcome -- absolute beginners totally welcome and encouraged!

Recommended Attire -- comfortable athletic clothing, such as T-shirt and shorts, rash guard, leggings, yoga pants, anything that allows easy movement and isn't overly baggy. (no belt buckles, please)

** Participate at whatever level of intensity works for you. Beginners are strongly encouraged to work slowly and at low intensity.

** No on-mat participation required; You are welcome to come and just watch.
