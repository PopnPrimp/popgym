At Pop Gym, it is very important for us to create [Saf(er) Spaces](safespace.md) for the benefit of our attendees' educational experience. At the same time, we also believe in ideals of Transformative Justice that attempt to see transgressors not as "rule breakers who should be punished", but as people with a lot of internalized oppression who have the potential to change. Finding the balance between the values of Saf(er) Spaces and Transformative Justice can be challenging, but we strive to do our best to make space for those affected by acts that transgress our Saf(er) Space policy, while also calling in those who have negatively affected others, with the hope that they can learn/grow from this experience. 

More concretely, here are some of the things we will do in our workshops if an attendee does not respect the space, boundries and/or limits of others:

At our workshops, we do not tolerate the following:

* any the use of language that purposefully demeans folks based on ability, activist experience, age, cultural background, education, ethnicity, gender, immigration status, language, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, self-expression, sexual orientation, species, status as a parent and all the ways they intersect. 
* any physical/emotional violence against other workshop participants.   

If a participant acts in any of the above ways, they will be asked to leave
