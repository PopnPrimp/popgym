Our weekly Sunday LGBTQ+ Yoga classes, facilitated by Kirsten, will aim to engage with a variety of bodies and experiences. Whether new to yoga or familiar but in need of modifications, Kirsten will teach a class that both challenges and encourages participants to trust their bodies. An eclectic playlist will keep us moving, breaks will keep us breathing and poses will help us find ourselves in community with each other.

Kirsten is a 32 year old white, cis-passing gender confused queerdo, who grew up in Queens and has been calling Brooklyn home for 12 years. They're interested in movement practices that heal and embrace the fullness of all bodies. With sciatica and chronic pain, they're learning to honor their body rather than force it. Yoga has helped them through depression, pain and life shit. 

Feel free to email them regarding the class or modifications: Adoriank@gmail.com
