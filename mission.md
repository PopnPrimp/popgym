<i><center>Strength in ourselves, strength in our communities. Free classes for fitness, self-defense, and self care.</i>

Pop Gym believes that everyone should access to skills that are necessary for their survival. Our mission is to open up a space in which folks who do not have access to these skills can attend classes on fitness, self-defense, and a variety of other skill sets. While that dream is a long-way away, we are actively taking steps to reach this goal!

Until then, we are hosting a bunch of great free self-defense workshops around NYC (and surrounding areas). Check our schedule for a workshop near you, or email us to set one up for your group/organization</center>
