Palm Heels for the people! Don't get that joke? No worries! Come by this FREE Pop Gym Pop Up workshop at the Brooklyn Public Library (Jamaica Bay Branch) at 11:00 AM to learn some introductory skills that will keep you feeling safe. We'll be covering the basics: stretching, conditioning, technique, and theory, with the hope that participants will leave with some super useful foundations that will aid them in the day-to-day. Mix that in with some sweat and some movement, and you'll have an accessible and confidence-boosting good time for all. Whether you are a beginner, or someone with experience, come work it out with us!

Open to all ages! We'll be moving around, so participants should wear clothing in which they are comfortable stretching and sweating.

POP Gym is a new project, working towards opening a physical space in Brooklyn that offers free self-defense, fitness, and skill share classes 7 days a week. As we continue planning, we invite you to come by any of our events this summer! Our workshops have been described as, "fun", "holistic" and "empowering", and for any questions, comments, or inquiries for future workshops for you or your organizations, email us at info@popgym.org
