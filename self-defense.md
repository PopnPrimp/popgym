Palm Heels for the people! Don't get that joke? No worries! Come by our FREE Pop Up workshop to learn some introductory skills that will keep you feeling safe. We'll be covering the basics: stretching, conditioning, technique, and theory, with the hope that participants will leave with some super useful foundations that will aid them in the day-to-day. Mix that in with some sweat and some movement, and you'll have an accessible and confidence-boosting good time for all. Whether you are a beginner, or someone with experience, come work it out with us!

Great intro to martial arts for everyday folk, as well as a good training for staff of a group/org. Open to all ages! We announce these workshops pretty regularly, so keep an eye on our [schedule](schedule.md) to see if we're doing a #PopUp near you!
