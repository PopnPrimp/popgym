If you’ve ever wanted to learn about the sport of SUBMISSION WRESTLING, now’s your chance! This event is open to all LGBTQ people! Allies welcome. It’s low intensity and oriented toward beginners.

Interested but not sure if you can participate? Join us anyway and observe from the sidelines! Ask questions, meet attendees, and have fun.

This workshop is facilitated by special guest presenters from The Spectrum Wrestling Club

………….

SUBMISSION WRESTLING
It’s a full-body-entanglement sport where opponents lock up, grapple for control, and attempt to make each other surrender by using submission holds. It’s related to martial arts you might have heard of already, like Jujitsu, Judo, Sambo, or Trap Fighting.

Geared specifically toward absolute novices, this workshop will provide newcomers with a set of basic techniques that will allow them to hit the mats right away.

THE WORKSHOP WILL COVER
Safety concerns - how to play rough while minimizing risk
Objectives - closing the distance, taking the fight to the ground, finding a dominant position, and finishing a fight
Live training - attendees who choose to will get the chance to spar with one another or drill with a more experienced wrestler

QUEER COMMUNITY
The organizers and facilitators are committed to creating a safe and respectful space where queer people who are interested in martial arts can begin their training. No discrimination, no shaming, no harassment. Issues will be dealt with as quickly and tactfully as possible.

RECOMMENDED ATTIRE
Please come in comfortable athletic clothing, preferably tight against the body. T-shirt and shorts, rash guards, or yoga pants, are all fine! Please DO NOT wear belt buckles, or anything with hardware.

SUGGESTED DONATION
Donate what you can! No one will be turned away for lack of funds.
