Ever wanted to get into submission wrestling but we're sure where to start? Want to throw down with friends at a play party, but aren't sure how to avoid potentially-injurious maneuvers? Need a few moves to muddle your way through as an absolute novice?

We've got a workshop that could help with that!

The Beginner's Tool Kit for Submission Wrestling

How to get started in the sport of Submission Wrestling, starting from the very top! Submission Wrestling is a full-body-entanglement sport where partners lock up, grapple for control, and attempt to make each other surrender by using "submission holds." 

Geared specifically toward absolute novices, this workshop will provide newcomers with a set of basic tactics and techniques that allows them to hit the mats right away.

- Safety concerns: How to play rough while minimizing risk
- Objectives of the game: Positions and Submissions
- ** How to start a match ** Ways to Engage while starting on the mats
- Basic attacks and defenses

Intended for: Beginners who will be wrestling fellow Beginners. Novices looking for a way to get started on the mats. Anyone who'd like to add elements of safety to their rough play. 

Low intensity and slow pace are strongly encouraged.
........................................

This workshop features a functional warm-up, discussion and demonstration of movement techniques, technique practice, and opportunities for participants to try their new skills against resistance ("live training"), if they wish.


..........................................

Recommended Attire -- comfortable athletic clothing, such as T-shirt and shorts, rash guard, yoga pants, anything that allows easy movement and isn't overly baggy. (no belt buckles, please)

** If you are nervous about getting on the mats for a first time, you are also welcome to come and just watch (no on-mat participation required). Meet fellow attendees, ask questions, and check out what's going on here.

** By Donation. Suggested $1 - $10. Donate what you can, no one turned away for lack of funds.

Presenter(s):
Damien is a founding member of The Spectrum Wrestling Club, an LGBTQ-centered grappling group. He has a great interest in making submission wrestling accessible to people who may not feel comfortable in a conventional gym environment but who would otherwise enjoy the sport. And he is invested in helping to make "rough play" adventures as safe as possible.

Tasia presented twice earlier this year at previous Beginner Intro Workshops. She's friendly, patient, and loves working with newcomers. Tasia says: "As the denizen of a fat body, I am particularly committed to making wrestling fun for all bodies!"
