**Hey all!**

Weird time ain't it (to say the least). We know everyone is going through it on their own way, so we wanted to offer this lil distraction! This is a scary time, and it is in these times that we believe in communities coming together, learning and growing, for the sake of their own health and survival. We have seen so many cool folks take the lead the past few weeks with some v cool projects, so we just wanted to be helpful in the way we know best: self-defense programming! We love offering self-defense workshop, and have been doing so excitedly for the last 3 years, and hope that our classes can bring some piece of mind to folks.

We had so much fun with the first two workshops, that we decided to do them weekly! The workshops will be a lil bit different each time, so keep an eye at popgym.org or any of our social media (@popgymbk) for upcoming events!
