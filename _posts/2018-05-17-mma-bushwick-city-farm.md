Pop Gym MMA this Thursday at Bushwick City Farm! Check the below for more of the #kickbutt details!

Pop Gym MMA! A weekly series for folks who want to learn a little bit more than basic self-defense, in a safe, holistic, and body-positive environment. 

Come by these free introductory workshops that combine elements of Boxing, Muay Thai, BJJ, and other fighting arts with a pad-smacking-fun workout and an all around good time!

*6:30-7:30: Women/Trans/GNC/NB Class

7:45-8:45 General Class

Wear clothing you don't mind sweating in. Recommended for folks to bring their own wraps. If you got a favorite pair of gloves you like to wear, bring those too!
