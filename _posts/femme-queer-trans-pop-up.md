July 4th, instead of celebrating the fake Independence Day of a genocidal country.

​Join For Our Liberation for a free pop up self defense training with popgym and claimourspace from 5pm-7pm at Herbert Von king. Understanding how we are not free until we are all free and that we, the most vulnerable have the right to defend ourselves. Come in your best fits to train. There will be water, supplies and gear for community.

​Pride is year long and year wide. We’ll see you there!
