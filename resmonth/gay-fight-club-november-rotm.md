 1. McSherry
2. Muay Thai 
3. 2 years
4. Red Planet 
5. for now, just coaching GFC--but leading these classes has given me a lot of new insight about how much i love supporting people as they navigate their relationship to their bodies. i'm considering doing a certification in personal training or physical therapy some time in the future!
